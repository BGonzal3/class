		<h3>Cr&eacute;me Br&ucirc;l&eacute;e</h3>
		<p>Cr&eacute;me Br&ucirc;l&eacute;e is a classic French dessert featuring a brittle, caramelized sugar top that contrasts with the rich, creamy vanilla custard beneath. Served in individual remekins, it offers a delightful balance of flavors and textures, with the slightly bitter caramel complementing the sweet custard. The experience combines the satisfying crack of the caramel with the smooth, cool custard, often garnished elegantly with fresh berries or mint. </p>
